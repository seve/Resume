*Global reusable partials for FRESH themes.*

This folder contains generic reusable templates for FRESH resume assembly. These
are provided on a per-format basis (one set of partials for DOC, one set of
partials for HTML, etc.) and can be invoked from any theme that needs them.

- [/doc](/doc): Partials for MS Word (\*.doc) formats.
- [/html](/html): Partials for HTML (\*.html) formats.
- [/md](/md): Partials for Markdown (\*.md) formats.
- [/txt](/txt): Partials for text (\*.txt) formats.

Note that not every FRESH theme uses partials, and not every FRESH theme that
uses partials will use these predefined partials. FRESH themes may define their
own custom partials or forgo the idea of using partials altogether.
