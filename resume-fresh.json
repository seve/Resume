    "brief": "My love for computer science began midway through middle school and has only grown since.  From a mixture of both self-teaching and classroom experience I am now an avid Java, Javascript, and developer and familiar with Android development.  I love to face challenges and adapt to new problems faced, learning to use new tools along the way.
